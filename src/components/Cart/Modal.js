// Here we have created this small component to WRAPP THE CART COMPONENT
// BELOW IS ABOUT THE MODAL COMPONENT
//And in there now backdrop and modal overlay and this is how we could do it, or actually modal overlay like this to
//forward the content between the modal tech. But this is how we could do it if we would not be using the Portal.
// Now we technically don't have to use a Portal but to ensure that our HTML code is not all over the place
// in the final application, I will use Portals here. And therefore I will output two dynamic expressions here.
//Side-by-side and that will call the create Portal method
